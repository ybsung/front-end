## Thinking in React

  * Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy  
    * single responsibility principle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle
  * Step 2: Build A Static Version in React  
  * Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State  
    * Need to think of the minimal set of mutable state  
    * Don't Repeat Yourself  
    * Figure out which one is state  
      * Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn't state.  
      * Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn't state.  
      * Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn't state.  
  * Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live  
    * We need to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state   
      * Identify every component that renders something based on that state.  
      * Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).  
      * Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.  
      * If you can't find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component simply for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.  
  * Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow
