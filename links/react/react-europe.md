### 12:00 La nouvelle vague 
 
The new wave of frameworks won’t be frameworks at all. 
In this talk, Sunil will explore how compilers and bundlers will replace certain runtime dependencies, without degrading the development experience that we all love and depend on. We’ll discover strategies of incorporating these ideas into any regular app, how we can leverage component models from react/vue/ember etc to enhance these ideas, and my own take on tooling in this framework-less world.

### 14:30 What WebAssembly means for React 
 
There’s a big push to improve React’s perceived performance. And WebAssembly is fast. Could WebAssembly be part of the solution? In this talk, code cartoonist Lin Clark will look at what WebAssembly could mean for React’s performance, and how the new Fiber architecture makes that even more of a possibility.

### 18:00 How Streaming Can Supercharge React 
 
React’s server-side rendering speeds up page load times, but it’s far from the only performance boost we can get on the server. In this talk, I’ll discuss how exploiting streaming and parallel processing on the server and browser can get us faster time to first byte, faster time to first paint, and faster time to full interactivity.

### 09:30 Putting the fun in functional with Elm 
 
With React, Redux, ImmutableJS and friends, frontend development strive towards the functional approach proving to yield increased readability and maintainability. However, working in JavaScript, we never truly commit to the paradigm, but what if we did? The Elm language goes fully functional and as suspected, it comes with an ocean of benefits! 
 
Tereza Sokol 
React by day | Elm by night ❤️ . Author of elm-plot, contributes to carte-blanche, elm-belle and more. 
 
### 09:45 Integrating React Native with Native Infrastructure 
 
This talk will go over our approach of incremental React Native adoption within an already established native app. We will discuss the various problems that arise from using React Native in such a “hybrid” app model and in particular, discuss inter-app navigation and embedding React Native views into native shells and vice-versa. 
 
Mehdi Mulani 
Engineer at Facebook on React Native. Ex-Torontonian and Londoner, now in the Bay Area. 
 
### 10:00 Next generation state management 
 
Last years there have been great developments in state management libraries. Both Redux and MobX sprung from the React community and provide stand-alone, generic state management solutions. Both have gained big in popularity, and both have their own strengths and weaknesses. What can we learn from both approaches? Can we get the best of both worlds? Can we add a little Boabab and Cerebral to the mix? Is it possible to create a transparent reactive, snapshotable state container. With support for JSON patches, replayable actions, serialization, complex object graphs. With Redux & MobX compatibility, strong typing and runtime type checks out of the box. Get a glimpse of what next-gen state management might look like with mobx-state-tree. Largely designed by the MobX community and enforcing many best practices that have evolved over the last year.

### 11:30 Twitter for Mobile Web 
 
Twitter for Mobile Web is a complex PWA built with Node.js, React, Redux, Service Workers, and Webpack. This talk will cover how our team designs and builds one of the world’s most visited web apps. You’ll also hear about React Native for Web; how we approach network and render performance challenges; and how we use new web platform features.

### 14:00 The runtimes of React VR and use at Oculus 
 
Authoring VR content is time consuming and technically challenging, I’ll be providing an overview of how we are using the core strengths, merits of React Native and building on it to drive and improve app development within Oculus. I’ll go into more detail about the runtimes of both the native Android version and WebVR versions and how we utilize the improved engineer workflow the technology gives us access to. 
 
Mike Armstrong 
Former “long time” game developer and now a software engineer in Oculus. Working on React VR and making VR developers lives easier. 
 
### 14:30 Functional && Reactive 
 
With the advent of libraries like React, Redux and Immutable.js, it’s clear that there’s a shift away from imperative and object-oriented in the front-end towards a more declarative and functional approach. Meanwhile, libraries like RxJS and Mobx are spreading the use of Reactive Programming to model UIs via discrete, asynchronous event streams. How can we combine the best of both functional and reactive paradigms to model and build predictable UIs that control themselves? 
In this talk, Preethi will explain what “Functional Reactive Programming” is, how close React / Redux / Mobx / RxJs and others come in realizing Functional Reactive Programming, and what’s still fundamentally missing from these tools to achieve a true implementation of FRP. Lastly, she’ll describe when and why FRP is suitable (or not suitable) for building predictable and scalable UIs.

### 16:00 Animating the Virtual DOM 
 
We are biologically trained to notice motion: evolutionarily speaking, our survival depends on it. For this reason, animation when done well can guide your users. It can aid and reinforce spatial maps of our interfaces, and give us a sense that we understand interactions more deeply. For this reason, animation is incredibly powerful to convey meaning, but only when done well. 
But animating the virtual DOM comes with some intricacies that affect our implementations. In this talk, we’ll go over animating in React with a variety of methods, comparing and contrasting each. We’ll cover add-ons like ReactCSSTransitionGroup, using external libraries like GSAP, React-Motion, motion using RxJS, and transitioning state with D3. We’ll look inside some real systems, breaking down how we can create reusable components of animation principles for interchangeable yet cohesive patterns.

### 17:30 React as a Platform: A path towards a truly cross-platform UI 
 
React provides an abstraction between the description of a UI and the details of how it’s rendered on a given platform. The problem is that <div> and <span> are a hidden dependency on react-dom, and similarly, React Native’s <View> is an explicit dependency on Native, making both not quite as “cross-platform” as we want them to be. Learn how we as a community can get around these issues, and what we can unlock by doing so.

### 18:00 A Novel Approach to Declarative Animations in React Native 
 
Animations can make your app more pleasing to use and help the user understand state changes. This talk will give best practices on when to use them and an introduction of how to implement them in React Native with a deep dive into a new strictly declarative approach similar to CSS animations and transitions.
